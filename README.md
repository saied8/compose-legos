### How it works
- Android frameworks/support repositpry is added as a git submodule and various Samples directories are added as source directories to a project module.
- Samples are processed using ksp and runnable sample code is generated using Kotlin Poet.
- Generated samples are presented in the application.

### Todo
- [ ] Add a way to inspect running sample state
- [ ] Add runtime theme modification support
- [ ] Add Analytics
